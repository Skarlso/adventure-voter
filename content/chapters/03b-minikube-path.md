# Chapter 2: The Reliable Choice 🛡️

**Playing it safe!** You decide to go with Minikube - the tried and true option.

You've done this a hundred times. Open terminal, type the magic words:

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker
```

And... wait. And wait some more. Minikube is pulling images.

```
😄  minikube v1.32.0 on Darwin 14.0
✨  Using the docker driver based on user configuration
📌  Using Docker Desktop driver with root privileges
👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
🚜  Pulling base image ...
💾  Downloading Kubernetes v1.28.3 preload ...
```

Five minutes later...

```
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster
```

It works! But you've burned 15 minutes watching progress bars.

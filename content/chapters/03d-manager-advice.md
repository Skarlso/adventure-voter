# Chapter 2: The Wise Path 🤝

**Smart move!** You decide to ask your manager for guidance before diving in.

You walk over to their desk.

**You**: "Hey, I want to make sure I choose the right tool for our Kubernetes dev environment. Do you have a preference?"

**Manager**: "I appreciate you asking! Actually, our Platform team just released internal docs on KCP. They're using it for multi-cluster scenarios. It would be great if you could validate it works for local development too."

**You**: "Perfect! I'll try KCP then."

**Manager**: "Great! And here -" *hands you a coffee* "- you'll need this. Also, if you get stuck, ping Sarah in Platform. She's the KCP expert."
